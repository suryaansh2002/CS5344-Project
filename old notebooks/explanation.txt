# Explanation of x_image and x_text:

# x_image and x_text are intermediate layers within the model, not the entire models themselves.

# 1. Image Model (x_image):
#    The x_image variable is the result of applying the EfficientNetB0 base model to the image input (image_input).
#    The EfficientNetB0 model is a pre-trained image model that extracts feature representations from the input images.
#    After passing through EfficientNetB0, you apply:
#       - Global Average Pooling (GlobalAveragePooling2D) to reduce the spatial dimensions.
#       - A Dense layer with ReLU activation, followed by a Dropout layer to prevent overfitting.
#    So, x_image is the final feature representation for the image input after these transformations.
#
# 2. Text Model (x_text):
#    Similarly, x_text represents the result of processing the text input (text_input) through several layers:
#       - Embedding layer to convert words into word embeddings.
#       - LSTM layer to capture the sequence patterns and context in the text.
#       - Dense layer with ReLU activation, followed by a Dropout layer for regularization.
#    So, x_text is the final feature representation for the text input after these transformations.
